# 🎬 Movie Popularity & Trends — SQL Project

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **movie popularity, rental behavior, and revenue trends** using the PostgreSQL **DVD Rental database**.  
The objective is to apply SQL from **basic queries to advanced database concepts** such as CTEs, window functions, materialized views, triggers, and indexing.

This project was completed as an academic SQL project and is structured to demonstrate **real-world data analysis and database handling skills**.
